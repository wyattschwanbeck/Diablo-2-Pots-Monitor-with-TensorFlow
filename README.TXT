My pet project of love for diablo 2. For how beautiful this game is, the potions management in early game can be so mundane and frustrating.

This project is image recognition only. Each screenshot it takes is based on the position of the window of d2. Win32Gui package is a must and windowed version only(haven't even tested this code on full screen).
